`halp` is a command line utility that lets you display messages in morse code on your capslock LED, or any LED for that matter as long the appearance of the states of the LEDs are distinct for values of `0` and `1`. 

## Disclaimer

I am not responsible for anything going wrong with the system `halp` is run on, this is merely an educational project born as a product of boredom.
